# Studio

The browser page over a built scene.

<!-- examples:start: written by scripts/example_readmes.py from each script's docstring -->

## Your own panel

![Your own panel](media/00_your_own_panel.webp)

A folder of your own on the studio page: a slider, a button that tosses the cube, and a readout of its height.

`page=` on `rss.view` is called once after the studio's panels
are built; `studio.gui` is viser's GUI API, so code for a bare `ViserServer`
drops in. A viser callback runs on viser's thread and may only assign; touch the
simulation in `studio.each_step`, which runs on the main thread once per control
step. To pick the cube up, drag the hand's gizmo over it and down, press **Close**
under **Grip** and lift.

```bash
uv run examples/05_studio/00_your_own_panel.py
```

## Render a still and a video

![Render a still and a video](media/01_render.webp)

Headless: one path-traced still of a scene, then a short video of it running, with no page open.

`rss.Sim.render` photographs the scene through a declared
`rss.CameraSpec` and returns `{"rgb": uint8 [H, W, 3]}`. It is
path traced by `ovrtx` where the GPU has RT cores and draws the colliders alone
otherwise (see Rendering in the studio README). `rss.Sim.record`
steps the scene and writes what that camera sees to an mp4.

```bash
uv run examples/05_studio/01_render.py
```

## Opening it

```python
import robosimstudio as rss

scene = rss.Scene(cell="bench_075")
scene.add(rss.robot("yam_bimanual"))
scene.add(rss.box(name="cube", half=(0.025,) * 3, at=(0, 0.1, 0.2)))
scene.add(rss.sheet(name="towel", size=(0.3, 0.3), cells=(20, 20), at=(-0.15, -0.3, 0.05)))
sim = scene.build(control_mode="joint_position")

rss.view(sim)
```

`rss.view` serves the page on port 8080, prints its
address, and steps the scene until you close the tab or press **Stop server**.

## On the page

- Click a rigid body and it comes up on a handle you can drag. The body stays
  dynamic, so you can push one thing with another or tug on something a hand
  holds.
- Click a patch of cloth to pin it to a handle. A second click elsewhere adds a
  second handle, and **Move together** carries both as one.
- Drag an arm's gizmo to move the arm through IK. **Open** and **Close** under
  **Grip** move its fingers. What they close on stays in them only by friction,
  and that needs `physics=rss.MUJOCO_500HZ` (arm and rigid bodies in one engine); under the
  default a hand pushes a free body and cannot pinch one.
- **Pause**, **Speed** and **Reset** are in the Simulation folder.

`rss.view` opens with the `drive` panels, which are the ones above. On a task
it keeps the task's own as well: the **Goal**, the regions it is about, and the
**Policy** folder with **Run** ([Tasks](../06_tasks/README.md)).
`rss.view(sim, panels="all")` adds the rest:

| Folder | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Material | Live sliders on each cloth's fabric. Some changes rebuild the scene. |
| Physics | Sliders on the arrangement the scene was built with. |
| Record | Keeps what you drive as a take. |
| Video | Renders the last seconds to an mp4. |
| Appearance | Scenery, cloth look, lights and shadows. |
| Leader arm | Drives an arm from a real one. See [Teleoperation](../09_teleop/README.md). |

## Arguments

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `panels` | `"drive"` | `"drive"`, `"all"`, or a tuple of panel keys. |
| `page` | `None` | A function called with the session, to add your own controls. |
| `render_every` | `1` | Draw one frame per this many control steps. 4 trades frame rate for step rate. |
| `port` | `8080` | The port to serve on. |
| `share` | `False` | Ask viser for a public URL as well. |
| `handles` | `2` | How many things may be held at once, per kind. |
| `speed` | `"1x"` | Playback rate at start: `"1x"`, `"0.5x"`, `"0.25x"`, `"0.1x"` or `"max"`. |
| `dark` | `False` | Dark page and canvas. |
| `scenery` | `False` | Draw the bench. It is hidden by default because it swallows clicks meant for the gizmos. |
| `config` | `None` | A whole `StudioConfig`. The arguments above are applied on top of it. |

## Recording and video

**Start take** and **Stop take** write a run directory under `outputs/studio/`,
named after the scene and the time:

```text
outputs/studio/scene/20261005-040937/
  demos/0000/steps.npz        # every control step of the take
  demos/0000/meta.json
  demos/0000/privileged.npz
  demos/episode_results.jsonl
  demos/run_meta.json
```

**Export video** renders the state the page has buffered, without simulating
again, to `video_001_rtx/<camera>.mp4` in the same directory. A video needs a
camera in the scene:

```python
scene.add(rss.CameraSpec(name="front", eye=(1.6, 0.0, 1.3), look_at=(0.6, 0.0, 0.8)))
```

`eye` and `look_at` are in the world frame. The defaults keep every second
control step, 900 frames in all, and write 30 frames per second. Set
`video_fps`, `capture_every`, `buffer` and `out` on a `StudioConfig`.

## Rendering

Every picture -- the live camera view, the exported video, **World model**,
`./ctl snapshot`, `sim.render()` and a policy's cameras -- comes from one
renderer, picked in this order:

1. A name in code wins: `bench.Env(..., renderer="tiled")`. `"auto"` names none.
2. Else `ROBOSIMSTUDIO_RENDERER`, for a machine or a shell: `rtx`, `tiled` or `auto`.
3. Else `rtx`, path traced by `ovrtx`, where it is installed and the scene's GPU
   has RT cores -- T4, A10, A40, L4, L40S, the RTX cards. Else `tiled`, which
   draws the colliders alone: A100, H100 and B200 have no RT cores. The first
   picture says which and why, once; World model's switch says it on hover.

A named `rtx` is tried even on a GPU without RT cores, and raises where `ovrtx`
is not installed rather than drawing something else.

`uv run` and `uv sync` install `ovrtx` from a checkout by default (the `rtx`
dependency group, 1.8 GB from NVIDIA's index). On a machine that cannot use it,
leave it out with `UV_NO_GROUP=rtx`. With pip it is the `[rtx]` extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra rtx                     # from a checkout
pip install "robosimstudio[rtx] @ git+https://github.com/robosimstudio/robosimstudio" \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com   # into another environment
```

## Remote machines

The page listens on all network interfaces (viser's default; Newton's viewer
has no option to bind one), so anyone who can reach the port can drive the
scene. On a shared network keep the port behind a firewall and reach it with
`ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <box>`. `share=True` also asks viser for a public
URL, which opens from anywhere; the request blocks until the tunnel answers.
Pick the GPU with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, one page per process.

## The whole page from code

```python
import robosimstudio as rss
from robosimstudio_studio import StudioConfig, StudioSession

scene = rss.Scene(cell="bench_075")
scene.add(rss.robot("panda"))
scene.add(rss.box(name="cube", half=(0.025,) * 3, at=(0, 0, 0.2)))

config = StudioConfig(panels="all", share=False, out="takes")
StudioSession(scene.build(), config=config).run()
```

**See also:** `StudioConfig` for every field; `examples/00_getting_started/00_hello_world.py` and `examples/01_cloth/00_towel.py`.
